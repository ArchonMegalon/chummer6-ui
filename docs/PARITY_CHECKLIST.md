# UI Parity Checklist

Generated automatically from the parity oracle and current contracts catalogs.

- Regenerate command: `RUNBOOK_MODE=parity-checklist bash scripts/runbook.sh`
- Parity oracle source: `docs/PARITY_ORACLE.json`
- Tab catalog source: `../chummer-core-engine/Chummer.Rulesets.Hosting/Presentation/NavigationTabCatalog.cs`
- Action catalog source: `../chummer-core-engine/Chummer.Rulesets.Hosting/Presentation/WorkspaceSurfaceActionCatalog.cs`
- Desktop dialog source: `../chummer-presentation/Chummer.Presentation/Overview/DesktopDialogFactory.cs`
- Workspace Actions coverage compares parity-oracle action IDs to action `TargetId` values.
- Desktop Controls coverage compares parity-oracle control IDs to dialog control IDs in `DesktopDialogFactory`.
