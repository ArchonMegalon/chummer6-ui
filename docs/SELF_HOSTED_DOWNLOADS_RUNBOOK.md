# Self-Hosted Downloads Runbook

Purpose: publish desktop artifacts to a self-hosted downloads surface and verify that `/downloads/releases.json` serves non-empty artifacts.

Registry note:
`/downloads/releases.json` is now a compatibility projection.
The canonical promoted release record is `RELEASE_CHANNEL.generated.json`, materialized by `chummer6-hub-registry`.

## Prerequisites

1. Desktop bundle exists (`desktop-download-bundle` layout):
`RELEASE_CHANNEL.generated.json`, `releases.json`, and `files/chummer-*.zip|tar.gz|exe`.
2. Portal serves `/downloads/releases.json` from your storage topology and should carry the registry-owned `RELEASE_CHANNEL.generated.json` beside it.
3. Use preapproved runbook/script paths from repository root (`/docker/chummer5a`).
4. Optional unattended overrides:
`RUNBOOK_LOG_DIR` pins runbook log files to a known writable directory and `RUNBOOK_STATE_DIR` pins writable state (for example `DOTNET_CLI_HOME`) to a known writable directory.
5. Startup-smoke receipts copied during publish must be fresh and not future-skewed (default max age: `86400` seconds, default max future skew: `300` seconds). Override with `CHUMMER_PUBLISH_STARTUP_SMOKE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` / `CHUMMER_PUBLISH_STARTUP_SMOKE_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_SECONDS` (or shared `CHUMMER_DESKTOP_STARTUP_SMOKE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` / `CHUMMER_DESKTOP_STARTUP_SMOKE_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_SECONDS`) only when the release lane explicitly approves adjusted evidence windows.

## Recommended Production Topology

1. Default recommendation: use `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_DIR` with a self-hosted runner that can write directly into the portal downloads storage mount.
2. Reason: this keeps `/downloads/` self-hosted, lets the deploy job verify both the local manifest file and the live portal manifest, and matches the canonical topology enforced in repo docs.
3. Treat object storage as the alternate topology for environments where the runner cannot write to portal storage directly; keep portal proxying and live manifest verification enabled there too.
4. Start from [`docs/examples/self-hosted-downloads.env.example`](examples/self-hosted-downloads.env.example) and adapt it to your portal base URL and storage target.

## Mode A: Filesystem Deploy (shared mount)

Repository variables:
1. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_DIR`
2. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL`

Workflow path:
1. Push the release-ready source to `main` or run workflow `Desktop Downloads Matrix` from `main`.
2. If `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_DIR` is configured, deploy job `deploy-downloads` runs automatically after bundle generation.
3. `scripts/publish-download-bundle.sh` prunes superseded desktop artifacts from the target downloads root before syncing the freshly built bundle.
4. Job verifies local deployed manifest and live manifest URL.

Manual path:
1. `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-sync DOWNLOAD_BUNDLE_DIR=<bundleDir> DOWNLOAD_DEPLOY_DIR=<deployDir> DOWNLOADS_SYNC_DEPLOY_MODE=1 DOWNLOADS_SYNC_VERIFY_TARGET=<portalBaseOrManifestUrl> bash scripts/runbook.sh`
2. `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-verify DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_LINKS=1 DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_TARGET=<portalBaseOrManifestUrl> bash scripts/runbook.sh`
3. `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-smoke bash scripts/runbook.sh`

## Mode B: Object Storage Deploy (S3/R2 compatible)

Repository variables:
1. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_URI`
2. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_LATEST_URI` (optional)
3. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` (optional; required for many R2/S3-compatible endpoints)
4. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_REGION` (optional, defaults to `us-east-1`)
5. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL`

Repository secrets:
1. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
2. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
3. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional)

Workflow path:
1. Push the release-ready source to `main` or run workflow `Desktop Downloads Matrix` from `main`.
2. If `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_URI` is configured, deploy job `deploy-downloads-object-storage` runs automatically after bundle generation.
3. Job syncs bundle using `scripts/publish-download-bundle-s3.sh`.
4. Job verifies live manifest URL.

Manual path:
1. `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-sync-s3 DOWNLOAD_BUNDLE_DIR=<bundleDir> CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_URI=<s3://bucket/path> CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL=<portalBaseOrManifestUrl> [CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL=<endpoint>] bash scripts/runbook.sh`
2. `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-verify DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_LINKS=1 DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_TARGET=<portalBaseOrManifestUrl> bash scripts/runbook.sh`

## Mode C: Live `chummer.run` HTTP Publish

Use this mode when the release lane must promote the newest desktop bundle directly into the live `chummer.run` shelf instead of a mounted filesystem target or object store.

Repository variables and secrets:
1. `CHUMMER_RELEASE_UPLOAD_URL`
2. `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL`
3. `CHUMMER_RELEASE_UPLOAD_TOKEN`

Workflow path:
1. Push the release-ready source to `main` or run workflow `Desktop Downloads Matrix` from `main`.
2. If `CHUMMER_RELEASE_UPLOAD_URL` is configured, deploy job `deploy-downloads-http` runs automatically after bundle generation.
3. Job uploads the finished desktop bundle with `scripts/publish-download-bundle-http.sh`.
4. Job verifies the live `RELEASE_CHANNEL.generated.json` response from `chummer.run`.

Manual path:
1. `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-upload-http DOWNLOAD_BUNDLE_DIR=<bundleDir> CHUMMER_RELEASE_UPLOAD_URL=<uploadUrl> CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL=<portalManifestUrl> CHUMMER_RELEASE_UPLOAD_TOKEN=<token> bash scripts/runbook.sh`
2. `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-verify DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_LINKS=1 DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_TARGET=<portalBaseOrManifestUrl> bash scripts/runbook.sh`

Operational rule:
1. The public `chummer.run` shelf is latest-only. After a successful build with a configured live upload target, the new bundle must be published automatically; leaving `chummer.run` on an older build is a release-pipeline failure.

## Strict Test Gate Commands (host-side)

Use these when you want hard failures instead of soft-skips.

Prerequisite probe:
1. `RUNBOOK_MODE=host-prereqs bash scripts/runbook.sh`

Single wrapper command:
1. `bash scripts/runbook-strict-host-gates.sh [optionalTestFilter] [optionalFramework]`
2. If no framework is provided, strict wrapper defaults to `net10.0` to keep host runs on the cross-platform test leg.
3. Local strict stage defaults to `FullyQualifiedName!~Chummer.Tests.ApiIntegrationTests&FullyQualifiedName!~Chummer.Tests.Presentation.DualHeadAcceptanceTests&FullyQualifiedName!~Chummer.Tests.ChummerTest`; override with `TEST_LOCAL_FILTER` when needed.
4. Wrapper fails when tracked `git` worktree state changes during the run; set `STRICT_ALLOW_WORKTREE_DRIFT=1` only when this is intentionally expected.

Local tests:
1. `RUNBOOK_MODE=local-tests TEST_NUGET_SOFT_FAIL=0 TEST_DISABLE_BUILD_SERVERS=1 TEST_MAX_CPU=1 bash scripts/runbook.sh`
2. Optional offline attempt after successful restore cache: `RUNBOOK_MODE=local-tests TEST_NO_RESTORE=1 TEST_DISABLE_BUILD_SERVERS=1 TEST_MAX_CPU=1 bash scripts/runbook.sh`

Docker tests:
1. `RUNBOOK_MODE=docker-tests DOCKER_TESTS_SOFT_FAIL=0 DOCKER_TESTS_BUILD=1 bash scripts/runbook.sh`

## Expected Verification Outcome

1. `/downloads/releases.json` has `downloads` with at least one artifact.
2. `version` is not `"unpublished"` in deployment mode.
3. When `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_LINKS=true` (or `DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_LINKS=1`), each artifact URL/file in manifest verification is reachable.
4. Portal `/downloads/` renders artifact links that return HTTP 200.

## Portal Status Meanings

The portal manifest/page now distinguishes operator states explicitly:

1. `published`: real self-hosted artifacts are available.
2. `unpublished`: manifest is intentionally empty; no builds have been published yet.
3. `manifest-empty`: manifest exists but lists zero artifacts; treat this as a deployment/manifest generation problem.
4. `manifest-missing`: portal cannot find the self-hosted manifest or local artifacts.
5. `manifest-error`: portal found `releases.json` but could not parse it.
6. `fallback-source`: portal is using `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_FALLBACK_URL` instead of self-hosted artifacts.

Operational expectation:

1. Production/self-hosted deploys should end in `published`.
2. `unpublished` is acceptable only before the first release or in local-dev output that intentionally keeps the repo fallback snapshot.
3. `manifest-empty`, `manifest-missing`, and `manifest-error` should be treated as operator failures, not user-facing “normal empty state”.
4. Published portal builds do not ship the checked-in `Chummer.Portal/downloads/releases.json` snapshot, so a missing storage mount should surface as `manifest-missing`, not as a fake `unpublished` release feed.
