## Project Overview

Chummer is a character creation and management application for the tabletop RPG [Shadowrun, Fifth Edition](https://www.shadowruntabletop.com/products-page/getting-started/shadowrun-fifth-edition).

This repository currently has two tracks:

* **Legacy path**: the WinForms desktop app (`Chummer`) that continues to serve as compatibility reference and regression oracle.
* **Current multi-head runtime (Docker branch)**: API + shared presentation seam + gateway + active presentation heads (`Chummer.Blazor`, `Chummer.Hub.Web`, `Chummer.Avalonia`, `Chummer.Blazor.Desktop`, `Chummer.Avalonia.Browser`, `Chummer.Portal`). Dedicated play/mobile and coach heads now live outside this repo in `chummer-play` and `Chummer.Ui.Kit`.

## Current Multi-Head Runtime (Docker Branch)

The `Docker` branch is the current multi-head runtime architecture for this repository:

* `Chummer.Api` is the HTTP host for headless services and workspace routes.
* `Chummer.Application`, `Chummer.Engine.Contracts` (package-consumed authoritative contracts), `Chummer.Infrastructure`, and `Chummer.Presentation` provide the shared behavior seam.
* The authoritative contracts package exposes the host-neutral ruleset/plugin/script interfaces plus the shared workspace payload envelope for peer SR4/SR5/SR6 module expansion without changing the active runtime seam.
* `Chummer.Hub.Web` is the active `/hub` web head for the future ChummerHub product path. It sits behind `Chummer.Portal`, uses a dedicated `CHUMMER_HUB_PATH_BASE`, replaces the archived legacy `ChummerHub` app as the runtime-facing hub head, and now renders live hub search/detail/compatibility/install-preview data plus owner-backed publication draft and moderation flows, including queue approve/reject actions, from the shared `/api/hub/*` seams through same-origin browser fetches. The live head also embeds a lightweight Coach sidecar that reads protected AI gateway status, provider health, and recent conversation audits through the same same-origin fetch path so hub discovery and publishing flows can see curation-oriented AI health without switching to `/coach`.
* `chummer-play` owns the shipped `/session` and `/coach` web heads. This repo keeps the shared presentation seam, `ISessionClient`, launch/deep-link contracts, and the workbench-side coach sidecars, but it no longer builds or ships standalone play/mobile hosts.
* `/api/session/*` remains the dedicated session/mobile boundary. The seam exposes owner-backed session profile catalog/selection, per-character session runtime-state routes, session-ready RulePack listing, deterministic runtime-bundle routes, deterministic runtime-bundle issuance, and explicit runtime-bundle refresh/rebind receipts. Dedicated play/mobile heads should bind to the `ISessionClient` seam from the shared presentation/UI-kit packages instead of widening the workbench-oriented `IChummerClient` contract.
* `/api/ai/*` is the protected Chummer AI gateway/BFF boundary for future provider routing, quota enforcement, Chummer-grounded retrieval, and conversation orchestration behind `Chummer.Portal`. The current scaffold exposes protected status/provider/tools/retrieval-corpora/route-policy/route-budget/prompt-registry/build-idea/explain/preview/conversation/turn routes, including explicit `/api/ai/conversations`, `/api/ai/conversation-audits`, `/api/ai/conversations/{conversationId}`, `/api/ai/route-policies`, `/api/ai/route-budgets`, `/api/ai/route-budget-statuses`, `/api/ai/prompts`, `/api/ai/prompts/{promptId}`, `/api/ai/build-ideas`, `/api/ai/build-ideas/{ideaId}`, `/api/ai/hub/projects`, `/api/ai/hub/projects/{kind}/{itemId}`, `/api/ai/explain`, `/api/ai/runtime/{runtimeFingerprint}/summary`, `/api/ai/characters/{characterId}/digest`, `/api/ai/session/characters/{characterId}/digest`, `/api/ai/preview/karma-spend`, `/api/ai/preview/nuyen-spend`, `/api/ai/apply-preview`, `/api/ai/preview/{routeType}`, `/api/ai/chat`, `/api/ai/coach`, `/api/ai/coach/query`, `/api/ai/build`, `/api/ai/build-lab/query`, `/api/ai/session/transcripts`, `/api/ai/session/transcripts/{transcriptId}`, `/api/ai/session/recap-drafts`, `/api/ai/session/recap`, `/api/ai/docs/query`, `/api/ai/media/portrait/prompt`, `/api/ai/history/drafts`, `/api/ai/media/queue`, `/api/ai/media/portrait`, `/api/ai/media/dossier`, `/api/ai/media/route-video`, `/api/ai/media/assets`, `/api/ai/media/assets/{assetId}`, `/api/ai/admin/evals`, `/api/ai/approvals`, `/api/ai/approvals/{approvalId}/resolve`, and `/api/ai/recap` paths, plus contract-first `AiGatewayService`, `ProviderRouter`, provider-catalog, budget, retrieval, prompt-registry, prompt-assembly, build-idea catalog, AI-facing hub-search, explain-lookup, digest-summary seams, history-draft seams, portrait-prompt seams, action-preview seams, media-queue seams, conversation catalog/store, credential-selector, transport-options, execution-policy, media-job, media-asset catalog, evaluation seams, approval-orchestrator seams, transcript-provider seams, and recap-draft seams so `AI Magicx` can remain the primary tool-calling provider for `/api/ai/coach` and `/api/ai/build`, `1minAI` can remain the cheaper primary route for `/api/ai/chat`, `/api/ai/docs/query`, and `/api/ai/recap`, and server-side provider keys stay on the host instead of in browser or desktop heads. `/api/ai/preview/{routeType}` already returns the route decision, budget snapshot, grounding bundle, and a typed provider turn plan without calling an external provider, and those preview/turn contracts now carry optional workspace scope so `/coach` replays can preserve workbench origin even after launch-query state is gone. `/api/ai/tools`, `/api/ai/retrieval-corpora`, `/api/ai/prompts`, `/api/ai/build-ideas`, `/api/ai/hub/projects`, `/api/ai/explain`, `/api/ai/runtime/{runtimeFingerprint}/summary`, `/api/ai/characters/{characterId}/digest`, `/api/ai/session/characters/{characterId}/digest`, `/api/ai/media/portrait/prompt`, `/api/ai/history/drafts`, `/api/ai/media/queue`, `/api/ai/preview/karma-spend`, `/api/ai/preview/nuyen-spend`, `/api/ai/apply-preview`, `/api/ai/conversations`, `/api/ai/conversation-audits`, and `/api/ai/route-budget-statuses?routeType=...` now expose explicit tool, corpus, prompt, build-idea, hub-search, explain-lookup, digest, portrait-prompt, history-draft, media-queue, action-preview, conversation catalog, conversation-audit, and route-budget-status seams separately from the monolithic status projection. The tool catalog now advertises the v1.1 Coach surface explicitly: runtime summaries, character and session digests, Explain API calls, karma and nuyen simulations, build-idea and Hub project search, history-draft preparation, portrait-prompt preparation, media-job queueing, and apply-preview preparation. The application seam now treats that turn plan as the typed execution-plan boundary for future provider adapters instead of passing ad hoc route/request/grounding tuples, and the route-policy/grounding/transport path now carries typed allowed-tool descriptors instead of raw tool id lists. Route policies now also expose route-class and persona metadata, with the default decker-contact persona constrained to a short flavor line and evidence-first behavior. The router now prefers live-enabled providers before stub-only adapters and only selects providers that explicitly advertise the active route, so a configured fallback like `1minAI` can take over when `AI Magicx` credentials are present but its live transport is still disabled. The env-backed credential catalog also normalizes pasted key values by trimming wrapper quotes and accidental trailing `*` markers before slot rotation, so local `.env` key staging can tolerate copied placeholder artifacts without exposing secrets through Git. The new action-preview seam is intentionally non-mutating: karma, nuyen, and apply previews resolve through grounded runtime/character/session digests, carry optional workspace scope in requests and receipts, and return scaffolded receipts until real simulator/mutation backends land. The new AI-facing Hub seam keeps `search_hub_projects` inside the protected AI tool plane while still delegating search/detail resolution to the same owner-aware Hub catalog service used by `/api/hub/*`. The new explain-lookup seam keeps `explain_value` inside the protected AI tool plane as well, resolving capability-backed explain projections from runtime summaries, workspace-backed character digests, and active ruleset capability descriptors before future live Explain API traces land. The new portrait-prompt seam keeps `create_portrait_prompt` inside the protected AI tool plane too, resolving grounded prompt variants from runtime summaries and character digests before the separate media-job queue issues any portrait render request. The new history-draft seam keeps `draft_history_entries` inside the protected AI tool plane too, resolving scaffolded recap, timeline, journal, and character-history candidates from runtime summaries, character/session digests, and transcript metadata before any approval-backed canonical write is attempted. The new media-queue seam keeps `queue_media_job` inside the protected AI tool plane too, resolving grounded portrait/dossier/route-video queue receipts from runtime summaries, character/session digests, style-pack hints, and downstream media policy before the separate media pipeline is asked to render anything. The media, admin, approval, and session-memory routes are now explicit contract-first bounded stubs, so portrait/dossier/route-video jobs, media-asset catalog access, evaluation catalogs, recap/media/canonical-write approval flows, transcript ingestion, and recap drafting have stable APIs before vendor-specific integrations land. The community corpus is no longer a generic placeholder path: the retrieval seam now resolves typed Build Idea cards before packaging community retrieval items, and those cards are now also browseable through explicit protected API seams. The digest seam is intentionally shared-data-first: runtime summaries come from the runtime-lock registry, character digests come from workspace summaries, and session digests come from the session runtime-status surface instead of a parallel AI-only state store. Coach grounding now uses those shared digest projections directly, so preview/turn bundles carry live runtime, character, session, and optional workspace facts before falling back to route-only scaffold placeholders. The explain-lookup seam follows the same rule: runtime and workspace explain context come first, with descriptor-backed fallback notes when the active provider does not yet emit a live explain trace. The portrait-prompt seam follows it as well: the prompt comes from runtime and character digests first, with style-pack flavor only layered on afterward. The history-draft seam follows it too: source selection starts from session/runtime and character digests, with transcript metadata enriching the draft when available instead of replacing Chummer-owned state. The media-queue seam follows the same pattern: queue prompts start from runtime and character digests, with portrait-prompt variants and style-pack hints enriching the request before downstream renderers are invoked. The remote-http adapters continue to flow through typed outbound transport-request/transport-response seams, with live provider execution staying disabled unless both provider transport metadata and the global enable flag are configured. Protected turn routes still return deterministic Chummer-grounded scaffold answers with runtime/corpus citations, suggested follow-up actions, prepared tool invocation receipts, a short flavor line, and a structured answer payload (`summary`, `recommendations`, `evidence`, `risks`, `confidence`, `sources`, `actionDrafts`) whenever outbound execution is disabled or a provider relay fails. AI status/provider projections also distinguish adapter registration from adapter kind, credential-slot rotation, remote-http transport registration, and live-execution state, so today’s built-in stub adapters remain visible as scaffolded execution paths while env-configured remote provider transports can progress toward real server-side HTTP adapters without leaking provider endpoint/model details into UI heads. The protected conversation seam now stores owner-scoped attempted turn history through the same owner-backed file-store scaffold used elsewhere in the current local/self-hosted runtime, and each stored turn now keeps provider id, tool-invocation receipts, citations, structured answer payloads, route decisions, cache metadata, grounding coverage, optional workspace scope, and suggested follow-up actions alongside the raw message transcript, while `/api/ai/conversation-audits` exposes lightweight last-turn audit summaries for ops and secondary heads that do not need full replay transcripts. The dedicated `/coach` UI now uses the audit seam for summary cards, filters replay lists by runtime/character/workspace scope, reloads scoped `/api/ai/conversations/{conversationId}` traces so replayed turns can restore workbench origin without depending on the original launch query, and can fire scoped non-mutating action-preview receipts, grounded runtime-summary cards, and build-idea searches directly from stored action drafts and replayed suggested-action buttons. The grounding contract is intentionally Chummer-first: runtime locks, Explain API data, RuleProfile/RulePack metadata, build ideas, and session state are preferred before prose corpora.
* The AI gateway now also keeps an owner-scoped response-cache seam keyed by route type, normalized prompt, runtime fingerprint, and optional character/attachment context so repeated grounded turn requests can return deterministic cache hits without burning additional Chummer AI units. Cache-hit metadata flows back on turn responses and conversation history instead of hiding behind provider-specific transport behavior.
* `/api/ai/provider-health` now exposes protected provider-health, circuit-state, transport-readiness, and credential-slot projections, with optional `?providerId=...` filtering, so portal/ops tooling and embedded sidecars can see last-success timestamps, recent failure streaks, current base-url/model readiness, configured primary/fallback key counts, the last routed route/binding, and whether a provider remains routable before repeated live faults poison coach/build/docs routing.
* `/api/hub/search`, `/api/hub/projects/*`, `/api/hub/projects/*/install-preview`, and `/api/hub/projects/*/compatibility` are the first ChummerHub-style discovery/detail/install-preview/compatibility surfaces. They already aggregate RulePacks, RuleProfiles, BuildKits, NPC entries/packs/encounters, and runtime locks through shared browse/query and install-preview contracts, and RulePack/Profile discovery now surfaces bound publisher attribution when publication metadata is available so hub-style discovery does not depend on head-specific catalog composition.
* `/api/hub/publishers/*` now provides the first owner-backed publisher profile seam so hub publication and review flows can attach to stable publisher identities instead of draft-only owner ids.
* `/api/hub/reviews/*` now provides owner-backed review and recommendation records for hub items, giving publication flows a persistent review primitive before public aggregation and ranking land.
* `/api/hub/publish/*` and `/api/hub/moderation/*` now act as dedicated protected ChummerHub publication seams with owner-scoped persisted draft and moderation state. Drafts, submissions, and moderation receipts can now bind to stable owner-backed publisher profiles instead of carrying owner-only publication metadata. The current slice supports draft create/list/detail/update/archive/delete, submit-for-review, queue inspection, and explicit approve/reject moderation actions while the broader multi-user registry/reviewer model continues to deepen behind the same application contracts.
* `/api/buildkits/*` exposes a dedicated BuildKit registry seam for starter and career templates. The default registry is intentionally empty until real BuildKit sources are registered, but the public/workbench discovery boundary now exists.
* `/api/rulepacks/*` exposes a dedicated RulePack registry surface, and `/api/profiles/*` exposes curated RuleProfile install targets. Registry projections now merge owner-scoped persisted manifests, publication metadata (owner, visibility, review, shares), and install state from file-backed owner stores instead of hardcoding only overlay/system defaults. Hub detail surfaces also expose owner-scoped install history facts so prior applications remain visible even when the current install state is back at `available`. Public registry/search/preview routes are exposed through explicit endpoint metadata, while mutation routes remain protected and are not exposed through prefix-based allowlists. RulePacks now expose dedicated install preview/apply routes at `/api/rulepacks/{packId}/install-preview` and `/api/rulepacks/{packId}/install`, and profile preview/apply now execute through a dedicated application seam that persists owner-backed profile pinning plus nested runtime-lock installation receipts.
* `/api/runtime/profiles/{profileId}` exposes a dedicated runtime-inspector projection for a resolved RuleProfile runtime so support, hub, and future workbench surfaces can inspect fingerprints, install state, pack bindings, warnings, and migration preview data through one shared seam. Runtime fingerprints are resolved from content bundle identity, RulePack asset checksums, and provider bindings instead of only profile/version identifiers.
* `/api/runtime/locks/*` exposes a reusable runtime-lock catalog that now merges owner-scoped persisted runtime locks with the current profile-derived entries so saved, installed, pinned, published, and derived runtime fingerprints have an explicit registry path instead of living only inside profile detail payloads. Runtime locks now expose dedicated owner-backed save, install-preview, and install routes at `/api/runtime/locks/{lockId}`, `/api/runtime/locks/{lockId}/install-preview`, and `/api/runtime/locks/{lockId}/install`, and hub install previews surface owner install state before those mutation calls persist owner-backed lock copies and install history.
* `Chummer.Blazor` is the browser/web head, `Chummer.Avalonia` is the native desktop head, and `Chummer.Blazor.Desktop` is the desktop webview host. The active web and native workbench heads now both embed lightweight Coach sidecars that surface protected AI gateway status, provider health, and recent conversation audits against the active runtime context without forcing a switch to `/coach`; the web heads deep-link straight into `/coach`, while the native Avalonia sidecar now exposes a copyable scoped `/coach` launch URL for the active runtime/workspace context.
* `Chummer.Portal` is the single public gateway surface for the heads this repo still ships. It provides `/blazor`, `/hub`, and `/avalonia` locally, while `/session` and `/coach` are expected to proxy to external play/control-plane hosts.
* `Chummer.Web` is retained only as a compatibility/oracle asset and is not part of the default runtime or parity-check contract.
* Legacy hub policy: `ChummerHub` and `ChummerHub.Client` are archived compatibility assets only. They are not part of the active solution, public runtime, or future ChummerHub product path; all public-edge and hub work belongs behind `Chummer.Portal`.
* Default runtime registration currently enables SR5 and SR6 only. `Chummer.Rulesets.Sr4` remains a scaffolded/experimental module and is not part of the default headless/runtime path until import/open/runtime coverage is complete. Set `CHUMMER_DEFAULT_RULESET` to choose the explicit host default ruleset; if it points at an unregistered ruleset, shell/bootstrap flows fail with diagnostics instead of following plugin registration order.
* Legacy head policy: `Chummer` and `Chummer.Web` are oracle/parity assets only. Net-new user-facing behavior belongs in the shared seam and active heads; legacy changes must be limited to regression-oracle maintenance, parity extraction, or compatibility verification.
* Runtime compose flows target `chummer-api`, `chummer-blazor`, and `chummer-hub-web`; portal flows add `chummer-portal`, `chummer-blazor-portal`, `chummer-hub-web-portal`, and `chummer-avalonia-browser`. `/session` and `/coach` now proxy to external hosts instead of being built in-repo; no `chummer-web` service is part of the active product path.
* Migration execution backlog: [`docs/MIGRATION_BACKLOG.md`](docs/MIGRATION_BACKLOG.md).

## Decommissioned Legacy Runtime Components

The following legacy components are no longer part of the active product/runtime path:

* `Chummer.Web` is no longer part of the default compose/runtime stack and remains only as a compatibility/oracle asset.
* `chummer-web` is no longer an active runtime service or parity-test dependency.
* Static parity extraction from `Chummer.Web/wwwroot/index.html` has been replaced by the checked-in parity oracle at [`docs/PARITY_ORACLE.json`](docs/PARITY_ORACLE.json).
* `Chummer` (WinForms) remains a compatibility reference and regression oracle, not an active multi-head runtime host.

`docker-compose.yml` exposes:

* `chummer-api` (default service)
* `chummer-blazor` (default service)
* `chummer-hub-web` (default service)
* `chummer-blazor-portal` (under the `portal` profile; internal `/blazor` path-base host)
* `chummer-hub-web-portal` (under the `portal` profile; internal `/hub` path-base host)
* `chummer-avalonia-browser` (under the `portal` profile; internal `/avalonia` browser-head host)
* `chummer-portal` (under the `portal` profile; single landing + proxy gateway)
* `chummer-tests` (under the `test` profile only)

## Running the Docker Branch

The `Docker` branch is validated on Linux with `net10.0` tests through Docker and uses .NET 10 containers.

Start API only:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build chummer-api
```

Start API + Blazor UI:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build chummer-api chummer-blazor
```

Start API + Hub UI:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build chummer-api chummer-hub-web
```

Start API + Blazor + Portal landing surface:

```bash
docker compose --profile portal up -d --build chummer-api chummer-blazor-portal chummer-hub-web-portal chummer-avalonia-browser chummer-portal
```

Direct API access (local/dev/ops or private upstreams):

```bash
export CHUMMER_API_KEY="replace-with-strong-secret"
docker compose up -d --build chummer-api chummer-blazor
```

When set, `Chummer.Api` enforces `X-Api-Key` for non-public `/api/*` routes and both UI heads automatically forward the key.
Set `CHUMMER_PROTECT_API_DOCS=true` to apply the same API-key gate to `/openapi/*` and `/docs/*`.
This is the minimal direct-access fallback for local/dev/ops workflows or private upstream protection. It is not the primary public authentication model.

Hosted/public deployment posture:

* Expose `Chummer.Portal` as the only public origin.
* Keep `Chummer.Api` on a private network behind the portal.
* Use portal cookie auth plus signed portal-owner propagation for hosted/public identity.
* Treat raw `X-Api-Key` mode as local/dev/ops or internal proxy compatibility only.

Owner-scope dev/test bridge:

* `CHUMMER_ALLOW_OWNER_HEADER=true` enables request owner resolution from `X-Chummer-Owner` (override with `CHUMMER_OWNER_HEADER_NAME`) in `Chummer.Api`.
* Authenticated user identity still wins when present; the forwarded owner header path is disabled by default.
* This header seam is for local/test harnesses and portal-edge development only. It is not public authentication, and production/public deployments should use real portal or edge identity instead of trusting forwarded arbitrary owner headers.

Portal-auth owner propagation seam:

* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_OWNER_SHARED_KEY` enables signed portal-to-API owner propagation for authenticated portal requests.
* Configure the same shared key in both `Chummer.Portal` and `Chummer.Api`; the portal strips incoming signed-owner headers and emits fresh signed authenticated owner headers only for `/api`, `/openapi`, and `/docs` proxy traffic.
* `Chummer.Api` prefers this signed portal-owner context ahead of the dev/test `X-Chummer-Owner` bridge when both are present.
* Optional `CHUMMER_PORTAL_OWNER_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` tightens signature freshness validation on the API side (default: `300` seconds).
* This is the authoritative hosted/public bridge for owner-aware requests until full public identity/account management lands.

AI provider credential env vars:

* Configure server-side AI provider keys through ignored local env files or deployment secrets such as `CHUMMER_AI_AIMAGICX_PRIMARY_API_KEY`, `CHUMMER_AI_AIMAGICX_FALLBACK_API_KEY`, `CHUMMER_AI_1MINAI_PRIMARY_API_KEY`, and `CHUMMER_AI_1MINAI_FALLBACK_API_KEY`.
* Configure optional remote-http transport metadata separately through `CHUMMER_AI_ENABLE_REMOTE_EXECUTION`, `CHUMMER_AI_AIMAGICX_BASE_URL`, `CHUMMER_AI_AIMAGICX_MODEL`, `CHUMMER_AI_1MINAI_BASE_URL`, and `CHUMMER_AI_1MINAI_MODEL`. Both the base URL and model must be present before a provider is treated as transport-configured/live. These values stay internal to the server-side AI seam and are not exposed through UI-head contracts.
* Configure route-budget policy through `CHUMMER_AI_CHAT_MONTHLY_ALLOWANCE`, `CHUMMER_AI_CHAT_BURST_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `CHUMMER_AI_COACH_MONTHLY_ALLOWANCE`, `CHUMMER_AI_COACH_BURST_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `CHUMMER_AI_BUILD_MONTHLY_ALLOWANCE`, `CHUMMER_AI_BUILD_BURST_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `CHUMMER_AI_DOCS_MONTHLY_ALLOWANCE`, `CHUMMER_AI_DOCS_BURST_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE`, `CHUMMER_AI_RECAP_MONTHLY_ALLOWANCE`, and `CHUMMER_AI_RECAP_BURST_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` when local/self-hosted operators need route-specific Chummer AI unit limits that differ from the checked-in defaults.
* The current scaffold records one owner-scoped Chummer AI unit per submitted AI turn in a local file-backed usage ledger, so `/api/ai/status` and live turn receipts stop reporting permanent zero monthly consumption even before provider-native billing adapters land.
* Live AI turn endpoints now return `429 ai_quota_exceeded` receipts when a route would exceed its configured monthly or per-minute burst Chummer AI unit allowance for the current owner; preview endpoints remain non-consuming.
* `/api/ai/status` now includes live per-route budget status projections with consumed and remaining monthly/burst counters so `/coach` and future ops surfaces can show depletion before turn submission fails.
* `.env` is gitignored; use it only for local/dev bootstrap and keep real provider keys out of tracked files.
* `docker-compose.yml` forwards the AI provider credential and transport env vars into `chummer-api`, so local portal/coach stacks can exercise the same server-side routing and credential-slot accounting that hosted deployments use.
* `CHUMMER_RUN_URL` is the first-class alias for a dedicated `chummer.run` AI control plane. When it is set, the portal uses it as the default upstream for both `/coach/*` and `/api/ai/*` unless the more specific `CHUMMER_PORTAL_COACH_PROXY_URL` or `CHUMMER_PORTAL_AI_PROXY_URL` overrides are also set.
* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_AI_PROXY_URL` can still peel same-origin `/api/ai/*` traffic onto a different dedicated AI control plane while the rest of `/api/*` continues to target `Chummer.Api`.
* When `CHUMMER_RUN_URL` and `CHUMMER_PORTAL_AI_PROXY_URL` are both unset, the portal forwards the configured internal API key to protected `/api/ai/*` routes the same way it does for the main `/api/*` cluster. When either one is set, `/api/ai/*` peels onto the dedicated AI upstream without forwarding `X-Api-Key`.
* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_COACH_PROXY_URL` can still point `/coach/*` at a separate coach UI host, but most deployments should prefer the shared `CHUMMER_RUN_URL` alias so `/coach` and `/api/ai/*` stay on the same control plane by default.
* The current AI gateway status projection separates adapter registration, adapter kind, credential-slot rotation, remote-http transport registration, and live-execution state from configured primary/fallback key-slot counts per provider. It never returns raw key material.
* The remote-http transport path preserves typed outbound transport requests and responses even when live execution is disabled or a provider relay fails.

Portal auth scaffold:

* `Chummer.Portal` now registers cookie authentication and authorization so portal-edge identity can populate `HttpContext.User` before proxying.
* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true` turns on the minimal dev harness endpoints: `POST /auth/dev-login`, `GET /auth/me`, and `POST /auth/logout`.
* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_REQUIRE_AUTH=true` makes the portal require an authenticated cookie for `/api`, `/openapi`, `/docs`, `/blazor`, `/hub`, `/session`, `/coach`, and `/avalonia`; the landing page and `/downloads` remain public.
* The dev harness is only a bootstrap path for local/testing and for proving the portal-owner seam. It is not the final public identity system.
* Public deployments should prefer this portal-auth path over direct API exposure; keep `CHUMMER_API_KEY` as a fallback for local/dev/ops or internal service-to-service compatibility only.

Portal notes (current milestone):

* `/api`, `/openapi`, and `/docs` are served via in-process portal proxy routing.
* `/api/*`, `/openapi/*`, and `/docs/*` share the same upstream contract through `CHUMMER_PORTAL_API_URL`.
* `/docs` is self-hosted (no external CDN dependency) and loads local assets from the API host.
* `CHUMMER_PROTECT_API_DOCS=true` on the API service protects `/docs` and `/openapi` with the same `X-Api-Key` middleware as protected `/api/*` routes.
* `/blazor` is served through an in-process portal proxy to an internal `chummer-blazor-portal` instance configured with `CHUMMER_BLAZOR_PATH_BASE=/blazor`.
* `/avalonia` is served through an in-process portal proxy to an internal `chummer-avalonia-browser` host service configured with `CHUMMER_AVALONIA_BROWSER_PATH_BASE=/avalonia`.
* Set `CHUMMER_PORTAL_AVALONIA_PROXY_URL` to a different upstream or clear it to fall back to the built-in portal placeholder route.
* `/downloads/` is a local manifest-backed page, `/downloads/releases.json` is sourced from `CHUMMER_PORTAL_RELEASES_FILE` (default `/app/downloads/releases.json`), and `/downloads/<artifact>` serves files from `CHUMMER_PORTAL_RELEASES_DIR` (default `/app/downloads`).
* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_URL` now defaults to `/downloads/` so the landing page stays local-first.
* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_FALLBACK_URL` is optional and only used when local manifest/artifacts are unavailable; when unset, missing `/downloads/*` files return `404` instead of redirect loops.
* Set `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_PROXY_URL` to route `/downloads/*` through in-process YARP proxy mode instead of local-file mode.
* `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./Docker/Downloads` into `/app/downloads` for the portal service; sync `desktop-download-bundle` into this folder to make `/downloads` serve real binaries.
* Local sync helper: `bash scripts/runbook.sh downloads-sync <bundleDir> <deployDir>` (defaults: `dist` -> `Docker/Downloads`).
* Portal can forward `X-Api-Key` to API/docs/openapi upstream routes when `CHUMMER_PORTAL_API_KEY` is set (or when `CHUMMER_API_KEY` is present in the portal service environment), but this is intended for internal/private upstream compatibility rather than as the public auth model.
* Portal can also forward signed authenticated owner context to the API/docs/openapi upstream when `CHUMMER_PORTAL_OWNER_SHARED_KEY` is configured on both services; this is the authoritative hosted/public path for owner-aware requests, while `CHUMMER_ALLOW_OWNER_HEADER` remains a disabled-by-default dev/test bridge only.
* Portal cookie-auth scaffolding is always registered; enable `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DEV_AUTH_ENABLED=true` only for local/test login bootstrap and enable `CHUMMER_PORTAL_REQUIRE_AUTH=true` when you want the portal itself to enforce authenticated access to protected upstream routes.
* Non-portal default flows keep `chummer-blazor` at root and do not require path-base configuration.

Cloudflare Tunnel target (portal profile):

* If cloudflared is in another Docker stack, point ingress at the portal host port: `http://host.docker.internal:8091`.
* On Linux, add `extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]` to the cloudflared service if needed.
* If both stacks share an external Docker network, point ingress directly at `http://chummer-portal:8080` instead.
* Keep tunnel ingress as a single origin with catch-all fallback:

```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: chummer.example.com
    service: http://host.docker.internal:8091
  - service: http_status:404
```

Content overlay notes (`CHUMMER_AMENDS_PATH`):

* `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./Docker/Amends` into `/app/amends` (read-only) and sets `CHUMMER_AMENDS_PATH=/app/amends` for `chummer-api`.
* API startup now enforces content-bundle validation by default (`requireContentBundle: true`) and fails fast if effective content paths do not provide required bundle files such as `lifemodules.xml`.
* Set `CHUMMER_REQUIRE_CONTENT_BUNDLE=true` for other hosts (for example desktop in-process runtime) when you want the same fail-fast content validation behavior.
* Multiple amend roots are supported with platform separators (`:` on Linux/macOS, `;` on Windows) and `,`.
* Active overlay metadata is exposed via `/api/info` (`content.overlays`) and `/api/content/overlays`.
* Overlay manifests accept `mode`:
  `replace-file` (default) keeps exact-name file precedence and powers full-file overrides like `lifemodules.xml`.
  `merge-catalog` applies fragment overlays like `qualities.test-amend.xml` and `en-us.test-amend.xml` onto canonical targets (`qualities.xml`, `en-us.xml`) using deterministic priority order.
* Overlay manifests can include `"checksums"` entries (for example `"data/lifemodules.xml": "sha256:<digest>"`); each listed file is SHA-256 validated during overlay discovery.
* Release/sample amend packs under `Docker/Amends` must include checksum coverage for every `data/*` and `lang/*` payload file; CI enforces this with `scripts/validate-amend-manifests.sh`.
* Sample pack is included at `Docker/Amends/manifest.json` and is configured for `merge-catalog` with test XML content under `Docker/Amends/data` and `Docker/Amends/lang`.

Desktop artifact workflow:

* `.github/workflows/desktop-downloads-matrix.yml` publishes both Avalonia and Blazor desktop artifacts for multiple RIDs and generates `releases.json` with SHA-256 checksums.
* CI manifest generation now uses the shared `scripts/generate-releases-manifest.sh` path to keep local/runbook/workflow output logic in sync.
* Checked-in `Chummer.Portal/downloads/releases.json` remains a local-dev fallback snapshot and is excluded from published portal output; deploy environments must mount/publish real downloads storage and treat published manifest verification as source of truth.
* Local `scripts/generate-releases-manifest.sh` runs now also sync discovered desktop files into `Chummer.Portal/downloads/files` (configurable with `PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DIR`) so `/downloads/*` can serve generated artifacts without extra manual copy steps.
* The workflow uploads a `desktop-download-bundle` artifact in portal layout (`releases.json` + `files/*`) for direct sync into mounted portal downloads storage.
* Desktop heads default to in-process runtime (`CHUMMER_CLIENT_MODE=inprocess` by default). Set `CHUMMER_CLIENT_MODE=http` only when intentionally running as a thin API client, and provide `CHUMMER_API_BASE_URL` (required) plus `CHUMMER_API_KEY` (optional). Legacy alias `CHUMMER_DESKTOP_CLIENT_MODE` remains supported.
* Push trigger coverage includes shared runtime/presentation layers and portal/download publication paths (`Chummer.Application/**`, `Chummer.Core/**`, `Chummer.Desktop.Runtime/**`, `Chummer.Infrastructure/**`, `Chummer.Presentation/**`, `Chummer.Portal/**`, `Directory.Build.props`, `scripts/generate-releases-manifest.sh`, `scripts/publish-download-bundle.sh`, `scripts/publish-download-bundle-s3.sh`, `scripts/verify-releases-manifest.sh`, `scripts/validate-amend-manifests.sh`) so desktop and download-surface changes run the same artifact pipeline.
* Recommended self-hosted deployment: set repository variable `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_DIR` and use a self-hosted runner that can write directly into mounted portal downloads storage via `scripts/publish-download-bundle.sh`.
* Alternate object-storage deployment: set repository variable `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_URI` (plus optional `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_LATEST_URI` / `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_ENDPOINT_URL`) and credentials secrets (`CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) to publish the bundle via `scripts/publish-download-bundle-s3.sh` when the runner cannot write to portal storage directly.
* `scripts/publish-download-bundle.sh` now derives portal file-sync destination from `PORTAL_MANIFEST_PATH` and supports explicit override via `PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DIR` for non-default portal layouts.
* Manual object-storage sync helper: `bash scripts/runbook.sh downloads-sync-s3 <bundleDir>` (requires `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_S3_URI` and `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL`).
* Deployment mode (`CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_ENABLED=true`) enforces published-version verification (`CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_REQUIRE_PUBLISHED_VERSION=true`) and requires `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL` so local + live manifests are both validated.
* Deploy job hard-gate: after publish, deployment now verifies `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_DIR/releases.json` contains at least one artifact and fails otherwise.
* `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_DIR` is resolved on the workflow runner filesystem; automatic deployment requires a runner that can write to the portal downloads storage (for example, self-hosted runner with shared mount/network volume).
* Live deployment verification is required: set repository variable `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL` (portal base URL or direct `.../downloads/releases.json`) so deployment can verify the live portal endpoint after local deploy verification passes.
* Deploy job hard-gate: deployment fails when `CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_URL` is missing or when the live portal manifest has no published artifacts.
* Deploy verification enforces published manifests (`CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_REQUIRE_PUBLISHED_VERSION=true`) so `version: "unpublished"` cannot pass deployment gates.
* Deployment jobs now enable per-artifact verification (`CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_LINKS=true`) so manifest URLs/files are validated, not just manifest shape.
* Canonical topology: self-hosted runner publishes bundle into mounted portal downloads storage (`CHUMMER_PORTAL_DOWNLOADS_DEPLOY_DIR`), then verifies both local manifest file and live `/downloads/releases.json` endpoint before success.
* Treat object storage as the alternate topology, not the default: use it only when shared portal storage is unavailable and keep `/downloads/` proxy verification enabled.
* Example operator configuration: [`docs/examples/self-hosted-downloads.env.example`](docs/examples/self-hosted-downloads.env.example).
* Local verification helper: `bash scripts/runbook.sh downloads-verify <portalBaseOrManifestPath>`.
* Optional local strict artifact check: `DOWNLOADS_VERIFY_LINKS=1 bash scripts/runbook.sh downloads-verify <portalBaseOrManifestPath>`.
* Repo-local smoke helper for downloads sync + verify flow: `RUNBOOK_MODE=downloads-smoke bash scripts/runbook.sh`.
* Parity checklist generator: `RUNBOOK_MODE=parity-checklist bash scripts/runbook.sh` (writes `docs/PARITY_CHECKLIST.md` from `docs/PARITY_ORACLE.json` plus the active catalogs).
* Host readiness probe for strict gates: `RUNBOOK_MODE=host-prereqs bash scripts/runbook.sh`.
* Strict host-side gate wrapper (no soft-skips, defaults to `net10.0`): `bash scripts/runbook-strict-host-gates.sh [optionalTestFilter] [optionalFramework]`.
* Optional unattended path overrides: `RUNBOOK_LOG_DIR` controls runbook log placement and `RUNBOOK_STATE_DIR` controls writable state such as `DOTNET_CLI_HOME`.
* Strict wrapper local stage default excludes API/parity and legacy host-mutating classes (`ApiIntegrationTests`, `DualHeadAcceptanceTests`, `ChummerTest`) so environment-free local checks run first; docker stage still runs full filter scope.
* Strict wrapper now compares tracked `git status` before/after run and fails on new worktree drift unless `STRICT_ALLOW_WORKTREE_DRIFT=1` is explicitly set.
* Manual deployment remains available through workflow dispatch with `deploy_portal_downloads=true`.
* Operator checklist for self-hosted publish/verify and strict host-side test gates: `docs/SELF_HOSTED_DOWNLOADS_RUNBOOK.md`.

## Legacy WinForms Requirements
| Operating System | .NET Framework |
| --- | --- |
| Windows 7 SP1 or 8.1+ | 4.8+ |

## Installation - Windows

Chummer uses a single tree release strategy with two release channels; **Milestone** and **Nightly**.

* **Milestone** releases are a fixed-point for use by living communities and people that prefer not to update their application regularly. These releases are considered to be stable and are recommended for general use. 
* **Nightly** releases are an automated build created with Appveyor at 0000 UTC daily. These releases are more likely to be unstable, but also receive new features and bugfixes faster than the Milestone releases. These are recommended for users that have a specific issue from Milestone that was resolved in Nightly, or are comfortable with testing features. 

1. Download the archive for your preferred update channel [Milestone](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/releases/latest) or [Nightly](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/releases) (Select the latest Nightly tag)
2. Extract to preferred folder location. If upgrading, you can extract over the top of an existing folder path.
3. Run Chummer5.exe.

## Installation - Linux and OSX

For the legacy WinForms desktop app, support for other operating systems is limited. For Linux, macOS, and Chrome OS, legacy Chummer can be run through one of three possible ways:

1. Set up and run [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), an open-source Windows compatibility layer. This is usually not for the faint-of-heart, especially on Chrome OS, but it is completely free. Some details about the steps necessary to run Chummer5a under Wine can be found on [the wiki](https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/wiki#installation). Note that even after you set up Chummer5a to run on Wine, Wine is not perfect and you will encounter some additional bugs while using Chummer5a that you wouldn't run into under Windows.
2. Set up and run [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover), a hassle-free version of Wine with commercial support. It costs money (though it has a limited free trial), but what you are effectively purchasing is for someone else to do all the hard work setting up Wine for you, no matter what you want to run on it. If you do not want to mess around with technical stuff, we highly recommend using CrossOver.
3. Set up and run a Windows virtual machine through programs like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html), or [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/). You will need a valid copy of Windows and lots of disk space, but Chummer5a will run on a Windows virtual machine exactly how it would run under full Windows. Virtual machine hosts are generally not available for Chrome OS, though with some behind-the-scenes tinkering, it can still be possible to run a Windows virtual machine on Chrome OS.

## History

This project is a continuation of work on the original Chummer projects for Shadowrun 4th and 5th editions, developed by Keith Rudolph and Adam Schmidt. Due to the closure of code.google.com, github repositories of their code have been created as a marker of their work. Please note, Chummer 4 is considered abandonware and is not maintained by the chummer5a team, and exists solely for historical purposes.
